Coding Challenges Solved Using Python

Note to Grader
There are some additional computations beyond the ones required by the rubric.
I wanted to push myself computing key metrics that a corporate officer would expect to read

PyBank was solved using two methods:
main.py for PyBank uses basic Python commands and libraries
main_pandas.py for PyBanck uses the Pandas library. This was done through research BEFORE
I was exposed to Pandas in the class

In PyBank an additional column was created to compute the deltas in monthly P&L.  This approach
simplifies the indexing of the three data points (date, PnL, and PnL Delta) for comparison and
computation of totals, maxima, minima, and averages.

In PyPoll, the counter library was used to find the unique values in the candidates column. 
Once the four candidates were identified, their values were used to find the appropiate tallies.

To idenfity the winner, a count command was also used.

All programs have been annotated for ease of evaluation.
